# Smoke Loader Analysis:

## Summary :
	Smoke loader is the most seen malware by researchers these days (the days of writing this analysis) 
	so I decided to investigate it and write a full analysis report on the obfuscation techniques that are used 
	by the malware in human explanation as this is the difference between human and automated analysis

	Note:
		This report is focused on the deobfuscation of the techniques used by the malware to evade detection
		starting from the first stage not focused on extracting its configuration
